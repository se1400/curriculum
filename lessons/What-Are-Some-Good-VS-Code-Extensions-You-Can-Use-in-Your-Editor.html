What Are IDs and Classes and When Should You Use Them_ _ Learn _ freeCodeCamp.org.pdf
I’m going to give you numerous files, for each, I want you to design me an interactive slide show with html, css, and js (nothing else), that is desktop/mobile friendly. This presentation is for students to follow along during class and make sure the instructor stays on topic with the material of the course. I would like you to take each paragraph and summarize it into a concise concept.  As code examples are shown, include associated code under the concepts you present on the side.  Group similar concepts together in slides as long as there is room. You should follow the flow of the article when summarizing the slides, and only stick to content from the article.   Do not include the main title from the top of the article as a title slide. Just get into the content.   Please evaluate the article first, and figure out how you will break it up into related concepts. It needs to follow the flow of the article, and only cover material from the article. Nothing else.  Ask questions if you are unclear on anything.  When building/formatting the presentation file, do not insert logos, headers, footers, watermarks, contact information, or background images. Keep the content the focus and only use images if you have to communicate a concept.  Skip the quiz questions and don’t use them in this. I want the design to look clean, and only manually be navigated. You can use the color 
#881518 as a base color for your design.  The file name should be saved as a .html that contains all CSS, JS, and HTML.

Architected six-slide presentation structure covering HTML IDs and classes.
11s












Looking at this document about HTML IDs and Classes, I can see the following main concepts to cover:

The id attribute - what it is and basic usage
Referencing IDs in CSS - using the # symbol
ID naming rules - uniqueness, no spaces, valid characters
The class attribute - introduction and basic usage
Multiple classes - how to apply multiple classes to elements
When to use ID vs Class - best practices and use cases
I'll organize these into approximately 5-6 slides, grouping related concepts together where appropriate. Each slide will have the concept summary on one side and relevant code examples on the other side.

A few clarifications before I proceed:

Should I include navigation buttons (Previous/Next) or would you prefer keyboard navigation only?
Do you want slide numbers displayed (e.g., "1/6")?
Any preference for font choices or should I use standard web-safe fonts?
Let me create the interactive slideshow for you now:

Do what you think
