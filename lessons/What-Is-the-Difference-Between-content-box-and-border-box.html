What Is Color Theory in Design.pdf
I’m going to give you numerous files, for each, I want you to design me an interactive slide show with html, css, and js (nothing else), that is desktop/mobile friendly. This presentation is for students to follow along during class and make sure the instructor stays on topic with the material of the course. I would like you to take each paragraph and summarize it into a concise concept. 
As code examples are shown, include associated code under the concepts you present on the side. 
Group similar concepts together in slides as long as there is room. You should follow the flow of the article when summarizing the slides, and only stick to content from the article.  
Do not include the main title from the top of the article as a title slide. Just get into the content.  
Please evaluate the article first, and figure out how you will break it up into related concepts. It needs to follow the flow of the article, and only cover material from the article. Nothing else. 
Ask questions if you are unclear on anything. 
When building/formatting the presentation file, do not insert logos, headers, footers, watermarks, contact information, or background images. Keep the content the focus and only use images if you have to communicate a concept. Feel free to create examples to demonstrate the principles being taught.
Skip the quiz questions and don’t use them in this. I want the design to look clean, and only manually be navigated. You can use the color 
#881518 as a base color for your design. Make sure that the next and previous buttons to navigate the content are always visible and are fixed to the bottom of the page no matter how long the content is. You could use the position:fixed attribute, so that the content scrolls down behind the buttons. The file name should be saved as a .html that contains all CSS, JS, and HTML. Also, make sure that the page is responsive and works in a mobile environment as well as desktop. 
You don't need to ask for confirmation to continue to create the resources. Just go ahead and make them all now. I've attached the article and example questions.
