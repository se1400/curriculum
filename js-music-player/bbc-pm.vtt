00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 A lesson from the Spanish-Portuguese power cut yesterday.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.160
 Get yourself a battery-powered radio

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.800
 so you can find out what's happening

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.140
 as modern life disintegrates around you.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.720
 And maybe also a battery-powered torch.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.420
 Oh, and some batteries as well.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.740
 Now, on this programme, we're particularly keen

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.220
 on the keeping of a radio so you can hear PM

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.800
 even when the electricity grid has collapsed.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.260
 Someone else keen on radios in emergencies

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.460
 is James Cridland, editor of Pod News,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.700
 a radio futurologist who consults and speaks

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.780
 on the topic of radio's future.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.040
 I spoke to him from Australia earlier

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.560
 where it seems they get a lot of use

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.440
 out of their battery-powered radios.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.100
 The bushfire is heading towards Omeo,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.300
 Angla's Rest, Dinner Plain and Kabungra.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.080
 This fire is threatening homes and lives.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.300
 Here we have events all the time

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.080
 in terms of fires and floods and everything else.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.880
 And we are told again and again,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.620
 go out and buy a battery-operated radio.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.560
 Make sure you've got batteries for it as well,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.180
 which is just as important too.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.760
 Yeah, but I suppose the wind-up radios

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.780
 would be better because I know that I actually

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.480
 don't listen on a battery-operated radio very often.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.800
 And the day that I need that darn battery-operated radio,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.180
 the batteries aren't going to be up to date, you know.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.180
 Yes, well, wind-up radios are absolutely fine.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.340
 Of course, most radio is on DAB now

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.860
 and that means, you know, you'd need to go out

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.580
 and find a wind-up DAB radio.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.060
 But, you know, radio's always made sure

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060
 that it is an emergency service.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.220
 One of my earliest memories, actually,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.940
 was 1978 in Somerset.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.840
 I remember my parents being very excited

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.100
 because the BBC put up a special emergency radio station

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.520
 for us after a large storm.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.340
 You're tuned to the BBC emergency station, Radio Taunton.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.700
 Good morning.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.960
 This is Peter Davis and I bid you a very big welcome

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.300
 to the opening of Radio Taunton on 224 metres medium wave.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.120
 During the present emergency in Somerset caused by snow...

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.160
 It's been doing this for a long, long time.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.700
 What do you use them for in Australia, out of interest?

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.260
 I know you do get storms and fires and things.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.120
 Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.660
 I mean, we get floods.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.080
 We get, you know, floods in places the size of Wales,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.260
 all completely underwater, and also fires as well.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.060
 And, of course, you know, we've seen bushfires

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.760
 happening in Canada as well, in the US.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 And the radio is probably the one thing

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.620
 that you can pretty well guarantee will work

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.580
 in some way, shape, or form,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.780
 because it's not reliant on cell phone connections and wires.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.040
 And that's an important part of, of course,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.080
 getting messages over to people.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.700
 The broadcasters, are they robust and resilient

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.600
 in the face of anything, be it a fire or a massive mega power cut?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.300
 Because, obviously, they do need power to transmit.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.760
 Indeed, they plan for things like that.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.540
 20 years or so ago, I worked in the building where you are,

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.100
 not necessarily exactly where you are.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.660
 We were planning how we would stream radio online,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.400
 and we had additional plans there in case anything happened

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.520
 to that particular area of London.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.480
 So it is something that is taken very, very seriously

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.280
 by radio companies and media companies across the world.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.700
 James, what else is in your emergency kit there?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.420
 Obviously, people are told, and people are literally advised,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.700
 to have a battery radio available in the event of something.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.540
 But what else is in your emergency kit?

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.060
 Yeah, indeed.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.140
 So we are told to have, you know, things like tinned food.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.280
 I mean, we had a cyclone only three or four weeks ago here.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:48.540
 So we made sure that we had enough tinned food to last for a good couple of days.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.960
 A battery powered radio, of course, a torch, just as important.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.440
 And again, enough batteries for that sort of thing as well.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.380
 And those things are really the important things alongside water.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.780
 My wife, to my surprise, as you can tell, I'm a Brit, but my wife is from here.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.260
 She filled up the bath full of water.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.420
 And I said, what are you doing?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.840
 And she said, well, we might need this, you know.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.160
 So there are important things that we just need to, you know, bear in mind there as well.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.460
 Radio buff, James Cridland there.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.680
 Not exactly selling Australia, I have to say.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.360
 There they get cyclones and storms.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.580
 Here we have, well, you know, a perfectly pleasant 22 degrees, don't we?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.460
 Let us get the weather.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.480
 It's Darren Bett today.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.880
 Darren.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.340
 Hello.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.200
 Yeah, well, it's warmer than that at the moment.
